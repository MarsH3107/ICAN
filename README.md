# ICAN: Attention-Based Knowledge Transfer for Microarchitecture Search

Official implementation of *"Seeing Through Designs: Attention-Based Knowledge Transfer for Preference-Guided Microarchitecture Search"*.

## Overview

ICAN enables cross-architecture knowledge transfer for microarchitecture design space exploration using:
- Graph Attention Networks for CPU architecture modeling
- Cross-attention fusion for architecture-EDA tool interactions  
- Meta-learning for rapid adaptation to new architectures
- Uncertainty-guided optimization with user preferences
